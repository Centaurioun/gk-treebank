This repository contains a grammar-book dependency treebank of Turkish.
The sentences in the treebank consist of the example sentences from a recent comprehensive grammar of Turkish by Göksel & Kerslake (2005).
The sentences are annotated following guidelines of [Universal Dependencies](http://universaldependencies.org/) project as much as
possible.
The detailed description of the annotations can be found [here](http://coltekin.github.io/ud-docs-tr/tr/overview/introduction.html) (soon to be restructured under the directory `doc/`).
A browsable version of the treebank is available at <http://coltekin.net/cagri/gk-treebank/>.
